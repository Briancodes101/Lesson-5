                    <h3>Overview of Astronomy</h3>
                Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the universe as a whole. It encompasses the
                observation and analysis of phenomena beyond Earth's atmosphere, including planets, stars, galaxies, and cosmological
                events.
                    <h3>Key Facts About Astronomy</h3>

                            <b>Historical Development:</b>
                            <p>Astronomy has evolved significantly since ancient times. Initially focused on tracking celestial
                bodies for calendrical and navigational purposes, it expanded with the invention of the telescope and the formulation of
                laws of motion and gravity in the 17th century.</p>

                        <li>
                            <b>Distance Measurement:</b>
                            <p> 
                 Determining distances in space is crucial. Techniques include triangulation using Earth's diameter
                as a baseline and measuring stellar parallax for nearby stars.</p>

                        <b>Planetary Sizes:</b>
                        <p>Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system, capable of containing all other planets within 70%
                of its volume. In contrast, Mercury experiences extreme temperature variations from -280°F at night to 800°F during the
                day.</p>
